            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>M. Night Shyamalan's Silence of the Lambs; a tight, confined chiller premise infused with empathetic intimacy. Shyamalan has never been a genre auteur, but a genre doctor, diving into various ideas and flavors and breathing a personal touch into their framework. The Sixth Sense isn't *just* a ghost story, Signs isn't *just* an alien invasion picture, The Visit isn't *just* a handheld/found footage exercise; they're all explorations of trauma and grief, of lost time and how it passes by like seasons in the year, of cinema's capacity to merge a thrill with a tear. Split is a classic melding of a 'locked-up' thriller and a tale of the emotional boundaries which constrict us, and it is yet another exemplary feature from one of the best directors in the business. Shyamalan reaches deep into the visual construction of a face - illuminating its power which has been inexplicable ever since cinema's beginning - to tell a story about what is beyond the physically apparent. His camera is always on the move. Roaming. Twisting. Following. Observing. All with a sly hint of uncertainty, bobbing in moments of great distress before committing itself to the stillness of a strange angle or a sudden rack-focus. Such a lens deserves a showcase, and it receives it in the form of a dual powerhouse between James McAvoy and Anya Taylor-Joy, a conflicting mental game which spars from the opening minutes of this entrancing exploration of tangible/intangible spaces. There's not a misstep in terms of form (watch how he creates caverns and caverns of rooms with such a limited location), but I'm sure my (slightly) low rating will vanish once I soak in the ramifications this deals with. </p>
