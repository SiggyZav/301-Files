            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>Malignant was a very enjoyable film in my opinion and really added a supernatural/suspenseful turn throughout the film. I think the way each character really had meaning in some way or another was very intriguing. Madison and her relationship with her past and what has kept Gabriel alive was interesting and when the whole plot twist in the final act makes everything understandable and a very fun watch. I really liked this film but being the first two acts kind of was predictable and overall just all over the place is the reason my score is a 4 star and not higher.</p>
