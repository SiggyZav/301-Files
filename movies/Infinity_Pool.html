            <h3>Review</h3>
            <p>You're a different person when you're on holiday. Infinity Pool is raw and uncompromised, extreme cinema at its most conceptual and intriguing. It's twisted, but in a way which is both beautiful and cold. Existing in a cryptic foreign land, Infinity Pool is about the selfish desires of Western tourists. It's about criminal hedonism and the fetishisation of other cultures. The lead character is guided by a seductive woman until he begins to question his identity and desires. Infinity Pool becomes a film of the body and its fluids, merging semen, blood, and urine into a sickening cacophony of excessive human excretion. Our lead's hallucinogenic adventure dehydrates his soul. Infinity Pool is very gross, but in execution it is a classy horror film with very artful vulgarity. It's about the tacky and unethical, hidden beneath respectable appearances. Infinity Pool is a tough watch and a smart horror film. It's sticky and disgusting, all wrapped around a fascinating central metaphor.</p>
